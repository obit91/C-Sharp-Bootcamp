# C# .NET-Core Bootcamp
## Introduction
As an experienced Java/Python developer, undertaking the challenge of learning C#, I've decided to create this project in order to achieve two goals:

1. Exercise C# specific capabilities such as: string interpolation, ref & out, null coalscing, structs and more.
2. Document the process of my training, in order to save time in the future when-ever I need a reference.
